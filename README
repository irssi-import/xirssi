 xirssi
 ------

Installation:

You need to have GTK+ v2.0 or later installed, and irssi sources compiled
with --with-glib2 option. Then the usual:

	./configure --with-irssi=~/cvs/irssi
	make
	make install

You *MUST* specify a direct path to --with-irssi.  Relative paths will fail
because GNU make won't know what to do with them anymore.
