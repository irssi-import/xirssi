 xirssi
 ------

Installation:

You need to have GTK+ v2.0 or later installed, and irssi sources compiled
with --with-glib2 option. Then the usual:

	./configure --with-irssi=~/cvs/irssi
	make
	make install

configure looks for irssi in ../, ../irssi/ and ../../irssi/ directories,
so if it's in one of those you don't need to give the --with-irssi option.
