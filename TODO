BUGS:

 - text widget problems:
   - everything fixed in gtk cvs?
      - crashing sometimes when closing windows (tabs?)

FEATURES:

 - window moving:
   - allow reordering split windows
   - .. should we change window's refnum when moving?
   - /window move has no effect - should it?

 - charset stuff:
   - channel-specific charset settings
   - convert nick info to utf8 for nicklist (some servers support non-ascii
     nicks) and statusbar (realname especially) and topic

 - keyboard:
   - fix yank_from_cutbuffer
   - redirections don't work
   - doesn't work at all with darix?

 - popups
   - channel/query popup for parting etc.
   - gui-context-channel.c for joining etc. probably irc-specific so it
     works with @#channel stuff in /whois etc.. also possibility to ask the
     channel topic with /list
   - nick popup:
      - uses /kickban -gui, maybe change go /guikick and implement it..
      - a way to remote-whois multiple nicks, needs a new command..

 - hilight colors in window activity aren't handled..
   they come as %codes, how to change them to rgb values?
   core changes required to parse them i think..

 - statusbar
 - lots of irc-specific stuff
 - nicklist: show ignored people with overstrike font, show away people
   with grey color (0.9 stuff maybe)
 - show notify list under nicklist
 - make /layout work
 - /set scrollback stuff to limit text buffer sizes
