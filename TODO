 - moving split windows up/down doesn't move their title
 - make utf8 optional
 - popups:
   - fix nicklist popup
   - add url popup
   - figure out some clean way to do popups :)
 - fix pango criticals (or rather wait for gtk+ people fix it)
 - keyboard:
   - move stuff from gui-entry.c to gui-keyboard.c
   - allow using hyper/super/all keyboard combos == fix gui_key2str() and
     move it to gui-keyboard.c too
 - allow moving tabs by dnd like galeon
 - add "window drag" button and remove those arrow up/down buttons. drag
   button could be used to move the window anywhere
 - add a combobox containing all windows / window items in the tab, so
   you can use it to switch to another channel or split window and easily
   see which is currently active
 - statusbar
 - lots of irc-specific stuff
