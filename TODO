 - hilight colors in window activity aren't handled..
   they come as %codes, how to change them to rgb values?
   core changes required to parse them i think..

 - text widget problems:
   - fix pango criticals (or rather wait for gtk+ people fix it)
   - crashing at startup because of: 
      - layout saved windows
      - /echo foo ~/.irssi/startup + autoconnect to server
   - crashing sometimes when closing windows (tabs?)..


 - window moving:
   - moving split windows up/down doesn't move their title
   - allow moving tabs by dnd like galeon
   - add "window drag" button and remove those arrow up/down buttons. drag
     button could be used to move the window anywhere
   - .. should we change window's refnum when moving?

 - charset stuff:
   - channel-specific charset settings
   - convert nick info to utf8 for nicklist (some servers support non-ascii
     nicks) and statusbar (realname especially) and topic

 - keyboard:
   - fix yank_from_cutbuffer
   - redirections don't work
   - pgup/pgdown

 - popups
   - channel/query popup for parting etc.
   - gui-context-channel.c for joining etc. probably irc-specific so it
     works with @#channel stuff in /whois etc.. also possibility to ask the
     channel topic with /list

 - add a pulldown menu containing all windows / window items in the tab, so
   you can use it to switch to another channel or split window and easily
   see which is currently active
 - statusbar
 - lots of irc-specific stuff
 - nicklist: show ignored people with overstrike font, show away people
   with grey color (0.9 stuff maybe)
 - show notify list under nicklist

 - when connecting to server, the window won't scroll down sometimes..
   and first window's width isn't updated immediately after showing nicklist
   so it prints /names list too wide
