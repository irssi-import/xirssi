BUGS:
 - /upgrade causes a crash if you have a lot of windows, otherwise works fine

 - alt-a leaves focus to previous window (mjr)
 - pressing 3 keys at the same time:
18:13 <@joose> cras: ** (xirssi:11740): CRITICAL **: file keyboard.c: line 563 
               (key_pressed): assertion `key != NULL && *key != '\0'' failed
 
 - quitting sometimes crashes in different places...

gui = NULL at quit

FEATURES:

 - window moving:
   - allow reordering split windows
   - .. should we change window's refnum when moving?
   - /window move has no effect - should it?

 - charset stuff:
   - channel-specific charset settings
   - convert nick info to utf8 for nicklist (some servers support non-ascii
     nicks) and statusbar (realname especially) and topic

 - keyboard:
   - fix yank_from_cutbuffer
   - redirections don't work
   - shift-tab = reverse completion

 - menus / popups
   - channel/query popup for parting etc.
   - gui-context-channel.c for joining etc. probably irc-specific so it
     works with @#channel stuff in /whois etc.. also possibility to ask the
     channel topic with /list
   - nick popup:
      - uses /kickban -gui, maybe change go /guikick and implement it..
      - a way to remote-whois multiple nicks, needs a new command..
   - make menubar optional, show menubar stuff in right-click-popup

 - hilight colors in window activity aren't handled..
   they come as %codes, how to change them to rgb values?
   core changes required to parse them i think..

 - setup:
    - server list can't be reordererd.
    - add gui stuff
    - in add server/channel dialog, when chat protocol is changed the
      network list should be updated to list only networks using that proto
    - separate irc stuff from glade file, and make it work.
    - add colors, themes and advanced logging pages
    - add popup menus

 - clean about dialog, add ccr there
 - lots of irc-specific stuff
 - nicklist: show ignored people with overstrike font, show away people with
   grey color (0.9 stuff maybe)
 - show notify list under nicklist
 - make /layout work
 - tooltips into buttons in main win

 - window switcher: use a treeview here...
